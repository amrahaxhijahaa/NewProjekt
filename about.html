                <p>UNNA Pastry was created as a way to combine creativity, hard work and passion for baking high quality pastries. We first started with a simple desire to make special family and friendly events with delicious handmade cakes. After numerous requests from friends and relatives for our sweets, we realized our dream of being the leader in the Kosovo market for the most delicious.
                Unna Pastry is a private family business that has operated successfully in the production of sweets.
               It was opened on July 20, 2021 in Rahovec.</p>
